Include at least one graphic showing two or more variables to represent the relationship between features
Describing my findings
## Model Development
Including my reasons for selecting the models I  use as well as a statement of the problem type
Code to fit the baseline and comparison models
## Model Evaluation
Describing the performance of the models based on an appropriate metric
## Business Metrics
Defining a way to compare your model performance to the business
Describing how my models perform using this approach
## Final summary 
Including recommendations that the business should undertake
